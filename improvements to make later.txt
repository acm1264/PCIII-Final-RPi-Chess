this file can be used to jot down any ideas you have for things that may not be urgent but would be good to do if time

make images transparent in their background so highlighting a blank tile visibly makes the full tile highlighted, and highlighting
a piece tile will highlight all surrounding white space

Highlights: Yellow - move to blank tile, Red - move to occupied tile, Green - Selected tiles

possibly setting the state of the tile buttons to disabled if it is not a selectable tile based on turn (cannot select tile inhabited 
by opposing colored piece)
        - if the status is set to disabled it greys out the button, so it would be obvious which moves are possible. this could defeat
          the purpose of having highlighting, but it is an option
          
make 4x4 grids of blank tiles for each discard, when a piece is overtaken it can be moved to these tiles.
        - would require another instance variable that would keep track of the next discard tile to be filled for white and black
        - change the image of the discard tile to the image of the piece
        
make sure set code to go full screen display on pi, and have a way to exit out (like CTRL+C)

after implementing possible moves and time permits, add a check for whether a move of a non king piece would cause the king to be
contested.
